# SleepTimerPauseShow
Little program that hits space bar after 30 mins of inactivity on windows. Afterwards it exits out, so you would have to rerun it if it hits the spacebar.
It can't tell if the show is running so if you pause it to leave or go to sleep make sure you close it.  The show must respond to spacebar and the window must be active.

Not much to it, just a quick and dirty little program I hammered out.  If you want to change the time you will need edit main func and enter time.

Made this for my mom who keeps falling asleep watching her show.
